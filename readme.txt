Create Contact Form 7 forms from PDF forms.  Get PDF forms filled automatically and attached to email messages upon form submission on your website.  Embed images in PDF files.

== Description ==

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy84xqnj0Zk]

This plugin gives WordPress Admin Panel users the ability to add fillable PDF attachments to email messages of Contact Form 7.

If the PDF attachment has a PDF form, the plugin allows users to add fields to the CF7 form and/or link them to fields in the PDF.  The plugin also allows the attached PDF files to be embedded with images supplied by the CF7 form fields.

When your website visitor submits the CF7 form, the form in the PDF file is filled with CF7 form information, images are embedded and the resulting PDF file is attached to the CF7 email message.

An external web API (https://pdf.ninja) is used for filling PDF forms (free usage has limitations).  An Enterprise Extension, which enables performing all PDF operations locally on your web server (no external web API), is available upon request.

Known problems,
 * Many UTF-8 (non-latin) characters don't render properly after being filled.  Almost always the problem lies with the PDF viewers not rendering the text correctly.  There is a workaround in the works, however, currently it remains unimplemented.
 * Some third party plugins break the functionality of this plugin (see a list below).  Try troubleshooting the problem by disabling likely plugins that may cause issues, such as plugins that modify WordPress or Contact Form 7 in radical ways.
 * Possible issues with checkbox multiselect

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin allow my website users to work with PDF files? =

No.  This plugin adds features to the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7) interface in the WordPress Admin Panel only.

= Does this plugin require special software installation on the web server? =

No.  The plugin uses core WordPress features only.  No special software or PHP extensions are needed.  Working with PDF files is done through [Pdf.Ninja API](https://pdf.ninja).  It is recommended to have a working SSL/TLS certificate verification with cURL.

= How are the CF7 form fields mapped to the PDF form fields? =

There are two ways to map fields with this plugin.  The field mapper tool allows you to map fields individually and, when needed, generate new CF7 fields on the fly.  The tag generator tool maps to the fields in the PDF form using the random looking code in the CF7 field name that it generates.  Here is the format: pdf-field-{attachment-id}-{human-readable-field-name}-{random-looking-code}.  The '{attachment-id}' can be 'all' to allow it to map to all PDFs attached to the CF7 form (in case you ever want to swap out the PDF file without needing to fix the generated tags).  If you remove the random looking code, the field will no longer be mapped to the field in the PDF.

= My fields are not getting filled, what is wrong? =

If you reuploaded the PDF file and your mapping was using the old file ID then your mapping will no longer work and you will need to recreate it.
If you are using the field mapper tool, make sure the mapping exists in the list of mappings and the field names match.  If you are using the tag generator tool, make sure the attachment ID matches (or is 'all') and the base64-encoded part of the tag name is unchanged.
If you renamed the PDF field, you will need to remove the old mapping and recreate the mapping with the new name.

= How do I remove the watermark in the filled PDF files? =

Please see the [Pdf.Ninja API website](https://pdf.ninja) and the [Enterprise Extension plugin](https://maximum.software/store/pdf-forms-for-contact-form-7-wordpress-plugin-enterprise-extension/).

= How do I set up PDF form filling on my local web server? =

Please see the [Enterprise Extension plugin](https://maximum.software/store/pdf-forms-for-contact-form-7-wordpress-plugin-enterprise-extension/).
